Simple Login Website Project
===========================

This is a basic website project made for learning and practicing web development as a beginner.

What does this website do?
-------------------------
This website lets a user enter a username and password on a login page. If the correct username and password are entered ("admin" and "12345"), the user is taken to a simple admin dashboard page. If the login is wrong, an error message is shown.

What files are in this project?
-------------------------------
- `index.html`: The main page with the login form.
- `home.html`: The admin dashboard page you see after logging in.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript code that checks the login and moves you to the dashboard if you log in successfully.
- `styles.css`: The file that gives the website its green color theme and makes it look nicer.

What can you learn from this code?
----------------------------------
- How to make a simple HTML form for login.
- How to use JavaScript to get values from text inputs.
- How to check if a username and password are correct using JavaScript.
- How to show messages to the user (like alerts for success or error).
- How to use CSS to style a website with colors and layout.
- How to link different pages together (like going from login to dashboard).

This project is good for beginners who want to see how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript work together to make a basic interactive website.
